# Random-number-c-
## Description-
This program generates a random number between 1 and 100 and prompts the user to guess it. After each guess, the program provides feedback whether the guess is too low, too high, or correct. The game continues until the user guesses the correct number.
## Explanation-
The program seeds the random number generator using the current time.

It generates a random number between 1 and 100 as the secret number.

The user inputs their guess and the program tracks the number of attempts.

Feedback is provided for incorrect guesses, indicating if the guess is too low or too high.

If the guess is correct, a congratulatory message is displayed along with the number of attempts.

The game loop continues prompting the user for guesses until they guess correctly.

The program terminates after the correct guess or if the user decides to quit.

Random numbers are generated between 1 and 100 to keep the secret number within a reasonable range for the user to guess.
